#RoofPig

Roofpig is an animated, programmable and interactive Rubik's Cube for the modern web. It uses WebGL or plain Canvas (by way of [three.js](http://threejs.org/)) and is written in CoffeeScript.

##1. Usage

Download the minified roofpig.js library from XXX and three.min.js from YYY, and include it in the HEAD tag of your html like this:

```html
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="three.min.js"></script>
<script src="roofpig.min.js"></script>
```

Then for a cube to appear on the page, you only need to make a div with class='roofpig', and some configuration in a data-config attribute.

```html
<div class=roofpig data-config="alg=R U R' U R U2 R'"></div>
```

**Dependencies**

Roofpig needs jQuery and three.js to work.


##2. Configuration

Here is a fully configured example cube:

```html
<div class=roofpig style="width=140px; height=160px;"
  data-config="alg=R U' F+B' R2 F'+B U' R'|solved=UR-|colored=U U-|colors=F:B B:G U:R D:O R:W L:Y">
</div>
```

As you can see, the data-config format is "prop1=something|prop2=something else|prop99=blah".

The valid properties are: *alg, base, colored, colors, flags, hover, moreflags, pov, setup, solved, tweaks*, but we'll go over them in a logical order.

###2.1 Algorithms

Properties: *alg, flags:showalg*

####Standard notation

Roofpig supports (almost) all standard cube notation. 

Layer(s): F, B, R, L, U, D. M, E, S. x, y, z. Fw, Bw, Rw, Lw, Uw, Dw.

Turns: 2, ', 2'. You can also use Â², Z, 1 and 3.


####Roofpig extras

The standard slice and turn moves change the names of the cube sides. This is really impractical if you have a solution in FBRLUD and want to insert rotations to show off the interesting parts.

So Roofpig has "soft" rotations - which you can also think of as moving the "camera". R> rotates the whole cube the same way as an R move. R>> corresponds to R2, and R< and R<< to R' and RZ. Yes, F> is the same as B<.

Roofpig also allows combining moves. So you can do orientation safe slice moves like this: M = L'+R, E = D'+U and S = F'+B. And the 'w' moves like this: Rw = R>+L, Lw = L>+R, Uw = U>+D, Dw = D>+U, Fw=F>+B, Bw=B>+F

If you combine moves that can't be done in parallell, like L+U or Rw+Fw2, horrible and amusing things will happen

I could write much more, but trying things out in JSFiddle is probably more useful. Note that you can change the HTML and click Run to experiment. Here: http://jsfiddle.net/Lar5/MfpVf/

###2.2 Defining 'solved'

Properties: *colored, solved, tweaks, setup*

So we need to define how the cube looks when the alg has been performed. By default, it will be a regular full 6 color cube. But you can also mark some parts as 'solved' (dark gray) or 'ignored' (light gray), move things around and more.

But first we need to talk about Cubexp.

####Cubexp

To configure, we often need to define sets of stickers. So I invented a little language for that. I named it "Cubexp", since it's kinda similar to (but also very different from) Regexp.

Cubexps do one thing: Define a set stickers, out of the 54 on a cube. That's it. They do nothing else.

The simplest format is listing pieces. The whole U layer can be selected like this: "U UB UBL UBR UF UFL UFR UL UR". UBL selects all the stickers on the UBL corner piece. Listing more pieces adds to the selection. Note that U is the center piece.

To select individual stickers on a piece, use upper case and lower case letters. So the U *side* can be selected like this: "U Ub Ubl Ubr Uf Ufl Ufr Ul Ur".

This would be enough to define anything. It would also be tedious. So we have some shorthand formats.

- __F*__. Whole layers. "U*" is the same as "U UB UBL UBR UF UFL UFR UL UR". "UF*" adds "DF DFL DFR F FL FR" to that.

- __F-__. Everything *not* in these layers. "U-" is the same as "U Ub Ubl Ubr Uf Ufl Ufr Ul Ur". "ULB-" is "D DF DFR DR F FR R" (the DFR 2x2x2 block).

- __f__. A whole side. "u" is the same as "U Ub Ubl Ubr Uf Ufl Ufr Ul Ur".

- __*__. The whole cube. Useful for filtering (see below)

- __Filtering__. You can filter any shorthand to only select certain piece types. c = corners, e = edges and m = middles. Like this: "U*/c" is all the corners in the U layer, or "UBL UBR UFL UFR". u/me is "U Ub Uf Ul Ur". You get the idea.

####Setting up cube stickers.

Now that we know Cubexps, we can set things up.

The main parameters for this are *solved* and *colored*. *solved* stickers will be dark grey. *colored* stickers will have their normal colors. Any others will be the light gray os 'ignored'. Any sticker both in *solved* and *colored* will be *solved*.
